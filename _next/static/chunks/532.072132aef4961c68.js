What I remember the most from the EORE session is the fact that if I discover a suspicious items on the street I will have to step away to a safe distance and call the emergency services numbers. I know there are explosive remnants in my village and it scares me. I\'ve even seen some that have exploded. It\'s really scary, you don\'t know if they can explode or not. Surely, I already saw explosive devices that exploded in front of me. I have to help my grandma to plow her vegetable garden, I do not know if it is contaminated or not. For now, we have only started and we must check and do everything. We do everything by ourselves. We are checking by walking and ploughing."},"Shaha":{"Intro":"Shaha Ismael Muhammed, 8 years old, was seriously injured when her sister stepped on a\\nimprovised explosive.
