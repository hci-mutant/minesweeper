With one arm amputated, he regained his mobility thanks to HI\'s support.","Quote":"I was taking part in a spinning top tournament, a traditional activity in my region. During the game, my top landed in the nearby stream. When I tried to retrieve it, I came across a metal object that I hoped to make into a nice spinning top. But when I started shaping it with a knife, it exploded. I lost my left hand. Thanks to HI, I had physical and psychological help. Today, I can clearly see the positive changes in my life: I\'m happy to be with my family and look after my livestock."},"Footer":{"ButtonDonate":"Donate","ButtonOtherTestimonials":"Other testimonials"},"Istabraq":{"Intro":"Istabraq is part of the demining team in Salah Al-Din.","Quote":"I joined Handicap International\'s demining team in March 2023. I was inspired by a friend who was injured by a mine and lost her legs. Her tragic story reinforced my decision to become a deminer. Demining-operations are of great importance to local communities. We reconvert land for agriculture, improve people\'s livelihoods and guarantee safety for people traveling around in the region. This job really suits me in a way I hadn\'t imagined. It made me realize I can make an actual difference for the people living here."},"Lamngueun":{"Intro":"Lamngueun joined HI in 2006 as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expert. Today she heads an eight-member demining team.","Quote":"I grew up in Phine, a town in Savannakhet Province in Laos, which is littered with unexploded mines. I want to show that demining is not a profession reserved for men. I have seen my grandparents, parents, children and so many people in my community live in fear every single day. It\'s an honor to be part of the solution."},"Mujbil":{"Intro":"Mujbil Mizher Muhammad, 27, is a shepherd in the village of Al Salihiya, near Tal Afar, west of Mosul. In September 2017, Mujbil was looking after his sheep in the countryside, when the donkey he was riding on,, stepped on an improvised mine, causing Mujbil to lose both his legs.","Quote":"I remember the explosion really well. I was lying on the ground, trying to move my legs, but nothing happened. In the hospital, I was close to despair. Without legs, life wasnâ€™t worth living. But after two or three days of surgery, Handicap International took charge of my case and helped me with rehabilitation sessions and exercises. They gave me the strength I needed."},"Shaha":{"Intro":"Shaha Ismael Muhammed, 8 years old, was seriously injured when her sister stepped on a homemade bomb. The blast killed half her family. Shaha received an artificial lens, a platina jaw and suffers from mobility problems in her right arm.","Quote":"I was sitting on my father\'s shoulders when one of my sisters detonated an improvised explosive. The blast killed three family members and seriously injured three others. Luckily I had a very patient doctor. I had 7 jaw surgeries and 27 hand surgeries. Thanks to an implanted lens I regained some sight. To keep my hand moving, I receive physio sessions from Handicap International. I love my physiotherapist so much that I cry each time the session is over."},"Vadim":{"Intro":"Vadim spent the winter hiding in a cellar in the town of Bakhmout, scene of the longest and deadliest battle of the war in Ukraine.","Quote":"While I was taking advantage of a quiet moment between the fighting to go buy some food, my house was bombed. I hid in the basement of one of the city\'s theaters. It was the middle of winter, with no heating or electricity. Extreme freezing temperatures burned my legs. They had to be amputated. Despite what happened, I am happy to be alive! This is all thanks to the medical teams of Handicap International. Without them I would not be here. I\'m so grateful. I\'m still here!"},"Nazar":{"Intro":"Nazar lives in the village of Velyka Komyshuvakha, Kharkiv region - about a hundred kilometers from the current front line. According to HI\'s EORE teams, all fields around the village have been cleared. It is impossible for the few remaining farmers to cultivate their land. Nazar followed an information and awareness session from EORE.","Quote":"My name is Nazar, I am eleven years old. What I remember the most from the EORE session is the fact that if I discover a suspicious items on the street I will have to step away to a safe distance and call the emergency services numbers. I know there are explosive remnants in my village and it scares me. I\'ve even seen some that have exploded. It\'s really scary, you don\'t know if they can explode or not. Surely, I already saw explosive devices that exploded in front of me. I have to help my grandma to plow her vegetable garden, I do not know if it is contaminated or not. For now, we have only started and we must check and do everything. We do everything by ourselves. We are checking by walking and ploughing."},"Stats":{"Single":"In 2022, mines claimed another 4,710 victims","Multiple":{"First":{"Number":"1661","Description":"deaths caused by mines in 2022"},"Second":{"Number":"3015","Description":"injuries caused by mines in 2022"},"Third":{"Number":"85%","Description":"were civilians, of which 49% were children"}}}},"Won":{"AtLocation":{"advanced":"in Iraq","expert":"in Ukraine","novice":"in Laos"},"Description":"{{numberOfMines}} {{atLocation}}","Footer":{"ButtonDonate":"Donate"},"Title":"Won"}}')}}]);
