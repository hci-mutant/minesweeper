I know there are explosive remnants in my village and it scares me. I\'ve even seen some that have exploded. It\'s really scary, you don\'t know if they can explode or not. Surely, I already saw explosive devices that exploded in front of me. I have to help my grandma to plow her vegetable garden, I do not know if it is contaminated or not.
